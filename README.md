# How it working

When user click on the specefic span inside the calender the popup will show an input form, and will say hi add an event by just some clicks.
when it submit the input form with title, colors, start time and end time will show on the span that he/she selected.
Actually I used the angular calender library. and there alot of things that I can do. If there still something missing Sorry for that. Actuall the task was getting delay and I tried to submit it soon. 

I did't not used any Rest Api. I am storing event data in an Array of Object when you load the browser window the only default data will display not the added one.

It's need to explore the angular calender to grab all the things that we actually need.
Actually it need time read docs, to explore and find better things in angular calender.
