## Angular Calender task detail 
This is a single-page event calendar application that adds, deleting, reads, and updates an event with background color, title, etc.
it consists of day, week, and month tabs.


# How it working

When the user clicks on the specific span inside the calender the popup will show an input form and will say hi add an event with just some clicks.
when it submits the input form with the title, colors, start time, and end timethen it will show on the span that he/she selected inside the calendar.
Actually, I used the angular calendar library. and there are a lot of things that I can do. If there is still something missing Sorry for that. Actually, the task was getting delayed and I tried to submit it soon. 

I didn't use any Rest API. I am storing event data in an Array of Objects when you load the browser window the only default data will display not the added one.

It needs to explore the angular calendar to grab all the things that we actually need.
Actually, it needs time to read the docs, explore and find better things in the angular calendar.
